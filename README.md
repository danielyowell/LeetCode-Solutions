# LeetCode-Solutions

Hello!

My name is Daniel Yowell, and I'm a student pursuing computer science at the University of Oklahoma. "Pursuing" being the operative term, as it continues to elude my grasp despite my best efforts to understand it.

To sharpen my programming skills, I've gotten into LeetCoding and will continue to work my way up from easier to more complex problems. I will generally try to avoid reading solutions unless I give up or am curious to see other methods.

For the sake of organization, and also for posterity, I've consolidated all of my solutions into a single .cpp file, which can be viewed publicly here. Please excuse the snarky code comments that I leave for myself and forget to edit out before pushing to GitHub.

I certainly don't expect to hit all 1500 LeetCode problems, nor do I plan to. But my understanding is that deeply studying/internalizing a handful of problems is enough to build a strong programming intuition.

This repo will be updated at extremely irregular intervals, much like everything else in my life.

Happy browsing!
